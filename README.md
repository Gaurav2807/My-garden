# 🌱 My Digital Garden Journey
I have always been very fond of nature. I loved going on treks, watching the large old trees that have been there for unknown generations. Listening to the sound of independently flowing rivers, the chirping of birds, and experiencing the cold breeze of fresh air 🍃

But my job and other commitments confined me within the boundaries of my home, surrounding me with nothing but a cement jungle. I started to feel disconnected with myself and the world, and hence I decided to bring the jungle back to my home 🏡

I set up my own garden with the plants I love. It's been more than 1.5 years of being a plant daddy, and it's hectic yet enjoyable! 🌿

I have been collecting gardening data since day one, which has helped me keep track of watering schedules, fertilizer applications, pesticide treatments, and pruning sessions for each of my plants 📊
